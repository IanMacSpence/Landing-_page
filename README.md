# Landing_page
TOP Landing Page project

This project practices creating a landing page based off of a given image. 

I've previously practiced building a webpage with html and styling it with css. This project builds on those skills by practicing flexbox which allows for a more powerful and responsive way of positioning elements on a page. 

This project also involves a little more problem solving than previous projects as there was a lot more flexibility with the style in them, whereas this one I'm given a design and I need to make it from scratch. It's almost as if I was given a design in a job or by a client, so it seems quite job-like for me.
